This tool helps you simulate design proposals and evaluate the possible user experiences in the design proposals (therefore, it also assesses the performances of design proposals). 
The user experiences include:
- Crowd density, 
- Transfer distance, 
- Ease of wayfinding,
- Visual quality.



## More details will be updated soon.
