## AI Powered Modeling

This tool uses AI to generate Rhino models.

This tool can use 1) API for advanced cloud large language models (LLMs) or 2) locally installed LLMs. You can choose either or both, but the first one is more recommended. The first one is more accurate. The second one hardly works (too many errors because the local models are generally not smart enough).

## 1) Buy an API of large language models
Generate an API key here: [https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys), and top up some money in your account: [https://platform.deepseek.com/usage](https://platform.deepseek.com/usage). 

## or 2) Installing local models
First, download Ollama: [https://ollama.com/](https://ollama.com/) and install it.
Then, use Ollma to install a large language model. Here is an example:

-- Open your cmd (Press the Windows key on your keyboard, then type "cmd" and you will find it), 
-- Type any one of these: 
---- "ollama run qwen2.5-coder"
---- "ollama run llama3"

## More details will be updated soon.

## FAQs:
### Driver C is almost full (due to Ollama and large language models)
- Instead of using the system driver (usually Driver C), you can move the entire Ollama program folder to another driver.
- After moving the folder, don't forget to modify the environment variables accordingly.
